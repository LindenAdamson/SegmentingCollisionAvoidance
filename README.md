# Segmenting Collision Avoidance
_Linden Adamson_
## Overview
Segmenting Collision Avoidance is a work-in-progress algorithm I am developing for my "Bike for the Blind" senior capstone project.

## Functionality
### Complete
- Tracking of objects between frames
- Isolation of tracked objects' placement in 3D space from background, other noise
### To Come
- Utilization of GPU to achieve real-time usecase feasibility
- Placement of tracked objects in space where collisions can be detected
- Predict tracked objects' future movements
- Determine safe trajectories for the ego vehicle
### In Consideration
- Support for depth information in point cloud format, eg from a LiDAR device
